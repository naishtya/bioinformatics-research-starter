# 🧬 Bioinformatics Research Starter

This repository documents my bioinformatics learning journey, including research summaries, foundational transcriptomics concepts, and early-stage analysis practice.

The goal is to build a strong foundation in bioinformatics, computational biology, and research literacy.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Learn core bioinformatics concepts  
- Understand transcriptomics and gene expression analysis  
- Explore biofilm-related bacterial research  
- Practice scientific paper interpretation and summarization  
- Develop structured research documentation habits  
- Build foundation for AI + bioinformatics integration  

---

## 🔬 Learning Progression

### 📘 Phase 1 — Transcriptomics Research Foundation  

Focus:
- Understanding transcriptomics concepts  
- Research paper reading and scientific summarization  
- Biological context interpretation  

Current Study:
- Transcriptomics analysis of glabridin effect on biofilm formation in *Staphylococcus aureus*

Skills Developed:
- Scientific literature analysis  
- Biological pathway understanding  
- Research summarization  
- Translating experimental results into structured notes  

---

### 🧪 Phase 2 — Applied Differential Expression Analysis  

Practical DEG analysis projects using public datasets are maintained in separate dedicated repositories.

Example:
- Alzheimer’s disease differential expression analysis (GSE5281, GEO2R)  
  → See repository: `alzheimer-deg-geo2r`

This separation allows clearer organization between:
- Concept learning (this repository)
- Applied analysis projects (separate project repositories)
