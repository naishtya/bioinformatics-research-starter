# 🧬 Bioinformatics Research Starter

This repository contains beginner-friendly bioinformatics learning resources, research summaries, and basic analysis examples.
The goal is to document learning progress while building a strong foundation in bioinformatics and computational biology research.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Learn core bioinformatics concepts
- Understand transcriptomics and gene expression analysis
- Explore biofilm-related bacterial research
- Practice research paper interpretation and summarization
- Perform real transcriptomics data analysis using public datasets
- Build foundation for AI + bioinformatics integration

## 🔬 Learning Progression

### 📘 Phase 1 — Transcriptomics Research Foundation

Focus:
- Understanding transcriptomics concepts
- Research paper reading and scientific summarization
- Biofilm biology context

Current Study:
- Transcriptomics analysis of glabridin effect on biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus

Skills Developed:
- Scientific literature understanding
- Biological context interpretation
- Research summarization

### 🧪 Phase 2 — Differential Expression Analysis Using Public Datasets (GEO2R)

Focus:
- Public dataset exploration (GEO database)
- Differentially Expressed Genes (DEG) analysis
- Reproducible analysis workflow
- Biological interpretation of gene expression results

Key Activities:
- Dataset exploration and selection from GEO
- DEG analysis using GEO2R (web-based tool)
- Parameter configuration and validation
- Reproducibility testing (3 analysis replications)
- Interpretation of DEG biological relevance

## 🧪 Analysis Workflow

1. Dataset selection from GEO database
2. Group comparison setup (Control vs Treatment / Disease vs Normal)
3. DEG analysis using GEO2R
4. Multiple testing correction evaluation
5. DEG significance filtering (Adjusted p-value + Log Fold Change)
6. Result interpretation and biological context analysis

## 📊 Current Skills Development
- Public transcriptomics dataset exploration
- DEG analysis using web-based tools
- Statistical interpretation of gene expression data
- Reproducibility in bioinformatics workflows
- Scientific result interpretation

## 📘 Current Contents
- Transcriptomics summary:
  Effect of glabridin on biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus
